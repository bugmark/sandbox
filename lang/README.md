## Editor Actions

We generally use light-weight editors like Vim, VsCode, Atom, and Emacs.

These editors can be configured for fast code navigation and editing:

- file explorer
- fuzzy file finding
- mru (most recently used) finder
- split windows and tabs
- jump to definition
- running a terminal and repl
- source / test navigation
- snippets
